create a text file and name it "makefile"

add the content as 4 lines exactly as below
note that there is tab in last three lines, 
(space will not work, it will give error missing speparator) 
==============
git:
	git add .
	git commit -m "$m"
	git push -u origin master
====================

put the file in git project folder top directory.
now from the terminal you can give only one command

make git m="message"	

Note you can install make package if not already installed :

sudo apt-get install make
